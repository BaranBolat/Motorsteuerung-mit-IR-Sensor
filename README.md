# Motorsteuerung-mit-IR-Sensor

## Description

This project demonstrates how to control a 28BYJ-48 4-Phase Stepper Motor using an IR sensor and a remote control. The system allows for remote operation of the motor, making it useful for applications such as automation and robotics.

*What did I learn?*

- Programming an Arduino with an IR-Sensor and IR-Remote
- Controlling a stepper motor with an ULN2003 driver board
